# THIS IS MY TECHNICAL README - MY "HOW"

**[screenshot.png](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/Prachi_Sadhwani/blob/main/Labs/autonomous-artistic-agent/screenshot.png) is a screenshot of the bot working. uploaded on 5/3/22 because i was trying to get the bot on the class server first.**

### the plan
- as a part of the [lab exercise](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/Prachi_Sadhwani/tree/main/Labs/autonomous-artistic-agent/lab2_exercise_material), we had to research different APIs to work with. i decided to use discord and created a test bot as a start.
- i wanted to make a bot similar to [CareBot](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/783920039044317195)

### the research and resources
- i went through several youtube tutorials as well as the nextcord documentation to create the final bot
  - by using these two resources, i created my own reminder command.
- i used repl.it and [uptime robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep my bot online
  - [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) was helpful in setting up the web server
### integrated APIs
- [bob ross api](https://api.bobross.dev/) for the ~bob command
- [bored api](https://www.boredapi.com/) for the ~bored command
- i hope to add more features like:
  -  a breathing exercise command
  -  a calming/cute image command
