# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"

### purpose
my main goal was to create a bot similar to [CareBot](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/783920039044317195) because i loved its features. 
- i wanted to create something that would be useful but calming
- the reminder function was intended to create easy reminders so people could remind one another about events, calls, assignments, etc.
- i created the bob ross quote feature because i know that bob ross' quotes are iconically soothing and wholesome -- which is the point of this bot
- the bored feature was made to act as a distraction. sometimes when i'm sad or upset i like to distract myself. even the act of calling the bored command over and over again can be soothing

### icons and aesthetics
- i used [canva](https://canva.com) to create the icon and [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to determine the colours

### future plans for this bot
- i really want to develop this further to include more commands that could be useful.
- the original CareBot has a command that calls for pixel art gifs which i find very aesthetically pleasing
- i also want to include a hug command, similar to reminder. it would send someone a hug after a certain duration, like a surprise.
- during my research i found an API for affirmations which is quite relevant to what this bot is meant to do. 
- during my planning stage i wanted to make a bot that could do journal entries and to do lists -- act like a bullet journal of sorts but the logistics of it being on a server like the one for this class didnt make much sense
